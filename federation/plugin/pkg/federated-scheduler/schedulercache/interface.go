// Cache collects replicaSets' information and provides cluster-level aggregated information.
// It's intended for generic federated-scheduler to do efficient lookup.
// Cache's operations are replicaSet centric. It does incremental updates based on replicaSet events.
// ReplicaSet events are sent via network. We don't have guaranteed delivery of all events:
// We use Reflector to list and watch from remote.
// Reflector might be slow and do a relist, which would lead to missing events.
//
// State Machine of a replicaSet's events in federated-scheduler's cache:

//                          Expire
//
//
// Note that an assumed replicaSet can expire, because if we haven't received Add event notifying us
// for a while, there might be some problems and we shouldn't keep the replicaSet in cache anymore.
//
// Note that "Initial", "Expired", and "Deleted" replicaSets do not actually exist in cache.
// Based on existing use cases, we are making the following assumptions:
// - No replicaSet would be assumed twice
// - If a replicaSet wasn't added, it wouldn't be removed or updated.
// - Both "Expired" and "Deleted" are valid end states. In case of some problems, e.g. network issue,
//   a replicaSet might have changed its state (e.g. added and deleted) without delivering notification to the cache.

	// Note that both binding and assuming are done as one atomic operation from cache's view.
	// No other events like Add would happen in between binding and assuming.
	// We are passing the binding function and let implementation take care of concurrency control details.
	// The implementation also decides the policy to expire replicaSet before being confirmed (receiving Add event).
	// After expiration, its information would be subtracted.
